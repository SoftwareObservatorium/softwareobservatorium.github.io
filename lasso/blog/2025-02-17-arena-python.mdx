We're excited to share that our efforts to support Python in the LASSO platform are gaining momentum! A first version of the arena test driver for Python is now available on GitHub, accessible at [https://github.com/SoftwareObservatorium/arena-python](https://github.com/SoftwareObservatorium/arena-python).

**Key Features**

Our current development includes support for essential data structures used in LASSO:

* **LQL**: Our Lasso Query Language (LQL) implementation allows you to represent interfaces in a concise and readable manner.
* **SSN**: Sequence sheet notation is also supported, providing a convenient way to work with biological sequences.
* **Stimulus Response Matrices**: We've integrated the use of pandas DataFrames to create and manipulate these matrices.

**What's Next**

We're working on integrating our Python support into the LASSO platform, specifically the LSL pipeline language. This will enable you to leverage the full power of LASSO in your Python workflows.
