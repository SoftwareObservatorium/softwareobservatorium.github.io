# Stimulus Response Matrices

Stimulus Response Matrices (SRMs) serve as configurations of tests and implementations, and Stimulus Response Hypercubes (SRHs) for software analytics of observed behavior.

For a detailed introduction to SRMs and practical examples, refer to our [lecture slide set on Advanced Software Engineering](/web/pdfviewer?f=L10-Test-Driven-Software-Experimentation-24.pdf).

## Schema for Stimulus Response Matrices (SRMs)

see [CellValue](../development/CellValue.md) schema.

## Analyzing Stimulus Response Hypercubes (SRHs)

see [Analytics](../analytics/data.md).
